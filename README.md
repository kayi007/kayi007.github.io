# About Me
I am a hard-working and passionate individual with an urge to learn new technologies and skills. After graduating from UCLA (Linguistics Major, Specialization in Computing) and working for a year and half, I decided to continue my studies at UCLA Extension Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp, further exploring my interests and pushing my abilities.

I have a strong curiosity of how others see the world and to perceive life from others' perspectives, to learn how people deal with the same problem in a different way. Traveling force you to take in new and refreshing perspectives. That's one of the reasons why I love travling so much.

My interests have always been around languages (human or computer) and Human-Computer interaction. With the creation of technologies like Siri and Google Translate, they made our life easier to do tasks. I believe that making an application to reach its full potential not only require inovative ideas, but also with great designs. As a future Software Engineer, I want to be able solve problems in creative ways while hopefully impacting the lives of others.
